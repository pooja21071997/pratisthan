          <p class="fw-semibold fs-6 founder-text">
           Recognizing the need for significant changes in education, Dr. Avinash Acharya, who has been actively involved in social work in Jalgaon district, introduced the educational initiative known as Vivekananda Pratishthan after thoughtful consideration.
            <br /><br />
            He established a unique system to nurture students’ creative abilities, focusing on their overall growth rather than just academic success. This approach involved non-traditional education methods and aimed to cultivate various qualities in students, such as culture, discipline, hard work, social responsibility, patriotism, character, affluence, sportsmanship, a positive mindset, and creativity. The foundation’s vision was to shape a generation of youth that is dedicated to the nation.
            <br /><br />
            As Swami Vivekananda believed, education’s primary purpose is to cultivate humanity. A child learns from within, but we can assist in their growth. The true essence of education lies in focused thinking. Concentration is the key to unlocking knowledge, which should be coupled with moral education. Education that respects a student’s native language is crucial for both teachers and students. Being pure, genuinely curious about learning, and having perseverance are important qualities for students. A teacher should possess strong character, be free from wrongdoing, and understand the significance of sacrificial teachings. The teacher’s influence is transferred to the student through direct and experiential means. Religion forms the foundation of education. What we require today is an education that builds character, enhances mental abilities, broadens the intellect, and empowers individuals to stand confidently on their own.
