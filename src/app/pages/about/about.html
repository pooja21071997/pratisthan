        Keshav Smruti Pratishthan has a unique approach to education. Instead of focusing solely on
        slates, notebooks, and books, our concept is more similar to the ancient 'Gurukul' system of
        India. We aim to create not just students with good memory, but citizens with strong
        determination and physical fitness. Our goal is to blend education and culture in a
        scientific manner. This led to the establishment of Vivekanand Pratishthan in 1987.<br /><br />
        We now have a spacious two-story building situated on a 10-acre piece of land, approximately
        7 kilometers from the city. This location accommodates classes from Grade V to Grade X, with
        around 1000 students enrolled. Approximately 50 students come from nearby villages, while
        700 students come from the city. For the convenience of our city students, we provide
        transportation using 8 buses. This year, we introduced a hostel facility for 200
        students.<br /><br />
        In the city, we offer pre-primary classes in the morning and primary classes (Grade I to
        Grade IV) in the afternoon. The school building here boasts a unique and attractive
        architectural design that is not commonly found in India. The surrounding gardens and
        greenery enhance the beauty of the campus. Across all sections of the institution, we have a
        total of 2200 students learning, supported by a staff of 150 teachers, including both
        teaching and non-teaching staff.<br /><br />
        In our city location, Keshav Smruti Pratishthan is involved in 11 projects, including
        Jalgaon Janta Sahakari Bank, Vivekanand Pratishthan, Matoshri Vruddhashram, Kshudha Shanti
        Zunaka Bhakar Kendra, Madhavrao Golavalkar Blood Bank, Eye-bank, Jalgaon Janta Infotech
        Private Limited, Ambulance Services, Ideal Village Projects, Deaf and Dumb School, and
        Balwant Credit Co-operative Society.<br /><br />
